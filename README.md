Installation Instructions:
1. Drag & drop the 'Vertex2Portal Converter.ms' file inside the startup folder. (<3ds Max Root Folder>\scripts\Startup [Same as you would've GIMS Evo])
-----
Using The Tool:
1. Go to the Utilities Tab (Wrnech Icon) & under the 'Vertices2Portal' menu, press 'Open'
2. Select your desired vertix/verticies
3. Press 'Format Portal Positions'
[NOTE: 3ds Max likes to add grouped verticies in it's own order. To ensure your Portal Coordinates are in proper order (CW, starting B.Left, looking from the inside), add verticies one by one. You have been warned]

5. Paste into CodeWalker
